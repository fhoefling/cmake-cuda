      "APPEND will write a message into a file same as WRITE, except "
      "it will append it to the end of the file\n"
      "NOTE: When using FILE WRITE and FILE APPEND, the produced file "
      "cannot be used as an input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) "
      "because it will lead to an infinite loop. Use CONFIGURE_FILE if you "
      "want to generate input files to CMake.\n"

      "variable.\n"
      "GLOB will generate a list of all files that match the globbing "
      "expressions and store it into the variable. Globbing expressions "
      "are similar to regular expressions, but much simpler. If RELATIVE "
      "flag is specified for an expression, the results will be returned "
      "as a relative path to the given path.\n"
      "Examples of globbing expressions include:\n"
      "   *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx\n"
      "   *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz\n"
      "   f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt\n"
      "GLOB_RECURSE will generate similar list as the regular GLOB, except "
      "it will traverse all the subdirectories of the matched directory and "
      "match the files.\n"
      "Examples of recursive globbing include:\n"
      "   /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories\n"
      "MAKE_DIRECTORY will create a directory at the specified location\n"
      "RELATIVE_PATH will determine relative path from directory to the given"
      " file.\n"
      "TO_CMAKE_PATH will convert path into a cmake style path with unix /. "
      " The input can be a single path or a system path like \"$ENV{PATH}\". "
      " Note the double quotes around the ENV call TO_CMAKE_PATH only takes "
      " one argument.\n"
      "TO_NATIVE_PATH works just like TO_CMAKE_PATH, but will convert from "
      " a cmake style path into the native path style \\ for windows and / "
      "for UNIX.";
